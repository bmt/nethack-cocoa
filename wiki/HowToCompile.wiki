= Introduction =

You need

 * Xcode (I used 3.1.3, older versions might work)
 * Mac OS X 10.5.7 (older versions might work as well)


= Details =

In order to build all prerequisites (dungeon definitions etc.) you have to build the tty port first (this is taken from the [http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Compiling build instructions on wikia]):

 * in src/Makefile, uncomment line 233 and comment out line 234
 * cd to sys/unix
 * sh setup.sh
 * cd ../..
 * in src/Makefile, uncomment line 233 and comment out line 234
 * in src/Makefile, on line 154, change CFLAGS -O to -O2
 * make (this builds the usual tty port)

Now you can load the xcode project (win/cocoa/nethack-cocoa.xcodeproj) and build the actual cocoa port.
